    <p>My name is Mohamed and I am a computer engineering student who is trying to follow his interest in web development and this portfolio project is a task from a course I am taking online and till now things are going great and I am benifiting from all of this. I hope to stand out in the web development field and have the ability to make money through it too.<br> Maybe one day at least.</p>
    <p>Some real info about me is that I am a random guy with a podcast who loves family dramas, videogames and music.</p>
